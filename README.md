# Soveltava projekti: Yet another corona stat

Input data is obtained from the [nCoV_tracker github page](https://github.com/eparker12/nCoV_tracker). 

The original source of the data that nCov tracker uses is [Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering github page](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series). This project refers to CSV form nCoV_tracker since it is readily modified for the purposes of this task.
